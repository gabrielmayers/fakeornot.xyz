        <h2 class="title-about">Can we use AI to identify Fake News?</h2>
        <p class="text-about">
            This was the main question for me when I built this project. AI is so poweful, so why not?
            But, obviously, we have some challenges here. The first one is: How? 
            Today, we have many examples to how apply Deep Learning models in classification tasks,
            but we cannot forget that when we're talking about classify news, we're talking about letters.
            Deep Learning models need to be inputed by numbers, so, the first challenge here is: Transform letters
            in numbers.
